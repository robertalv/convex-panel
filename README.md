## Installation

```bash
bun add convex-panel
# or
npm install convex-panel
# or
yarn add convex-panel
# or
pnpm add convex-panel
```

During installation, the package will automatically:
1. Check if you're logged in to Convex
2. If not logged in, prompt you to run `npx convex login`
3. Once logged in, detect your Convex access token from `~/.convex/config.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.convex\config.json` on Windows)
4. Add it to your project's `.env` file as `CONVEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`

The package will guide you through the login process if needed. You can also manually log in at any time by running:
```bash
npx convex login
```

## Usage

You can use the panel in two ways:

1. **Automatic Token Setup** (Recommended):
   The access token will be automatically loaded from your environment variables during installation.

2. **Manual Token Setup**:
   If you prefer, you can manually provide the access token by running:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.convex/config.json
   # or
   more %USERPROFILE%\.convex\config.json
   ```
   And then using it in your component:
   ```tsx
   <ConvexPanel
     accessToken="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" // Required
     deployKey={process.env.CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT} // Required
     deployUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL || REACT_APP_CONVEX_URL} // Optional
     convex={convex}
   />
   ```

Here's a complete example:
> **Warning**: This component must be placed inside a `ConvexProvider` or `ConvexReactProvider` component.


```tsx
import { ConvexPanel } from 'convex-panel';
import { useConvex } from 'convex/react';

export default function YourComponent() {
  const convex = useConvex();

  return (
    <>
      {/* Your app content */}
      <ConvexPanel
        accessToken="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        deployUrl={process.env.CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT}
        convex={convex}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

The Convex Panel accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `accessToken` | string | Yes | Your Convex access token (from `convex config`) |
| `deployKey` | string | Yes | Your Convex deployment URL (or use CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT env var) |
| `deployUrl` | string | No | Alternative to deployKey - your Convex deployment URL |
| `convex` | ConvexReactClient | Yes | Convex client instance |
| `theme` | ThemeClasses | No | Custom theme options |
| `initialLimit` | number | No | Initial log limit (default: 100) |
| `initialShowSuccess` | boolean | No | Initially show success logs (default: true) |
| `initialLogType` | LogType | No | Initial log type filter (default: ALL) |
| `maxStoredLogs` | number | No | Maximum number of logs to store (default: 500) |
| `onLogFetch` | (logs: LogEntry[]) => void | No | Callback function when logs are fetched |
| `onError` | (error: string) => void | No | Callback function when an error occurs |
| `onToggle` | (isOpen: boolean) => void | No | Callback function when panel is opened/closed |

## Features Documentation

### Health Monitoring

The health dashboard provides real-time insights into your Convex application's performance metrics:

- **Cache Rates**: Monitor your application's cache hit rates and efficiency
- **Scheduler Health**: Track the health and performance of your scheduled functions
- **Database Metrics**: View database throughput, operation counts, and response times
- **System Latency**: Visualize overall system response times and identify bottlenecks

### Data Editing

Convex Panel now supports in-place editing of table data:

- **Double-click Editing**: Simply double-click on any editable cell to modify its value
- **Smart Value Parsing**: Automatically converts edited values to the appropriate type (number, boolean, array, object)
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected in your Convex database

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

1. **"Convex authentication required"**:
   - Make sure you've provided a valid access token via the `accessToken` prop
   - Get your access token by running `cat ~/.convex/config.json` or `more %USERPROFILE%\.convex\config.json`

2. **No logs appearing**:
   - Verify that your `deployKey` prop or `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable is correctly set
   - Check that you've passed the `convex` prop to the ConvexPanel component
   - Verify that your access token is valid

3. **Build warnings about "use client" directive**:
   - If you see warnings like `Module level directives cause errors when bundled, "use client" in "src/data/components/FilterMenu.tsx" was ignored`, this is expected and won't affect functionality. The package is designed to work in both client and server environments.
